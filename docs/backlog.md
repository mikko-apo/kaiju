Here are items that might get implemented at some point

Git:
* basic features: commit changes, push
* advanced: branching & merging, project as part of product repository
* advanced: cherry picking items from branches

UI:
* obd view for smart groups: items on the left pane, item on right pane
* themes
* global search, searches from all fields
* graphs
** item counts over time (how many open, how many closed, how many in progress)

Use cases:
* Users want to see overview of sprint items
** -> User definable views. For processes for example: todo, in progress, done
* Users want to plan / visualize progress: Gantt chart
